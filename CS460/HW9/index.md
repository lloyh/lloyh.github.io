# Homework 9: An MVC web application and its Database deployed to the cloud

For this assignment we were tasked with publishing a web application that uses a relational database we created via an SQL scrip to a hosting service on the Internet. We used Microsoft Azure for the hosting portion of the application and the corresponding database. The project is directly derived from Homework 8.
